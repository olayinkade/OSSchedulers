Analysis:
when using Queues for each scheduler, Round Robin using a Priority queue, each
threads is assigned a fixed time slice and  it acts as first come first serve.
sorting by arrival time
The Priority Round Robin using a Priority Queue, the order for each threads be
served is according by its priority and arrival time.

Comparing Pure Round-Robin and Priority round-robin:
from the statistics, these two schedulers vary from themselves.
For the Pure Round-Robin,
it doesn't use the priority, we just run each process for a specific time slice.
The reason for a significant difference is that in pure Round-Robin, we run
each process for a fixed time slice, and the process will stop when it finishes
its time slice we place it back deducting the value of the time slice from it
and increasing the start time
in this case the waiting time goes up drastically.

For the  Priority Round-Robin,  the priority is being assigned to each process,
and going to treat each processes with higher priority.
1. it will longer running time for the low priority process.
2.  shorter running time for the high priority process.


The z-test tells us that
for when the priority 0
It is concluded that the null hypothesis Ho is rejected. Therefore, there is
enough evidence to claim that the population mean \muÎ¼ is less than 14162.7, at
the 0.5 significance level.
